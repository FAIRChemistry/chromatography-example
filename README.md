# Handling chromatographic data
 
This project folder showcases how chromatographic data can be currently handled using `chromatopy`. Besides the raw data, located in the `data/` folder, two Jupyter Notebooks are within this example project. In `shimadzu-example.ipynb` 8 chromatograms are read in at once and peaks of interest are extracted. In `single-chromatogram.ipynb` a single chromatograms is read in from a CSV file, the chromatogram is fitted and peaks are annotated.
